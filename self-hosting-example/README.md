### Directory Structure

/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runtimeVersions *(static file containing hosted runtimes)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/rvm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latestVersion *(static file containing latest RVM Version)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latest *(latest RVM)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/runtime  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.53.23.23 *(runtime)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.56.24.41  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.56.26.40  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stable *(static file containing corresponding runtime version)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beta  

This is the structure of the `public` directory, which mirrors the OpenFin [CDN](http://cdn.openfin.co/versions/).

## Step 1: Host Your Assets

To host this sample project:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch a webserver (on port 5555 or PORT environment variable).

To deploy your own, simply copy the public directory (or its structure) and host it with the web server of your choice.

## Step 2: Point To Your Assets

Overwrite all applications in the Window registry  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> SOFTWARE -> OpenFin -> RVM -> Settings`  
`Name: assetsUrl`  
`Type: REG_SZ`  
`Data: http://assetServerUrl`

Where http://assetServerUrl is the url of your hosted assets.

## Demo

This repository includes a sample app which targets a custom _legacy_ release channel, a sample channel specific to this project. The assets url is configured in the sample [app.json](https://github.com/openfin/hosting-demo/blob/master/app.json#L14) included in this project. To launch the sample application:

```bash
npm run oflaunch
```

The application dynamically populates a div with its current OpenFin version, as a number.
