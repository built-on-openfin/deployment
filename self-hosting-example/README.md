### Directory Structure

/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runtimeVersions *(static file containing hosted runtimes)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/rvm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latestVersion *(static file containing latest RVM Version)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latest *(latest RVM)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/runtime  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.53.23.23 *(runtime)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.56.24.41  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.56.26.40  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stable *(static file containing corresponding runtime version)*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beta  

This is the structure of the `public` directory, which mirrors the OpenFin [CDN](http://cdn.openfin.co/versions/).

## Step 1: Host Your Assets

To host this sample project:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch a webserver (on port 5555 or PORT environment variable).

To deploy your own, simply copy the public directory (or its structure) and host it with the web server of your choice.

## Step 2: Point To Your Assets

`Please set a DOS file in your registry to point to a assetsUrl` - https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/desktop-owner-settings  
`Path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\OpenFin\RVM\Settings\`  
`Type: REG_SZ (String value)`  
`Name: DesktopOwnerSettings`  
`Data: https://example.com/company/files/end-user-desktop-owner-settings.json`

Example DOS: 


    "desktopSettings": {
        "assetsUrl": "http://localhost:8000/",

## Demo

This repository includes a sample app which targets a custom version which is fetched from the custom asset location.

To launch the sample application load the launch page in the browser using the command below and then click on the fins link to launch the application:

```bash
npm run launch
```

The application dynamically populates a div with its current OpenFin version, as a number.
